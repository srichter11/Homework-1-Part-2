# Homework-1-Part-2
A simple app using storyboard, login screen, images, text fields, and push transitions.

To create this app, I started on the login screen. 
I edited the properties of the text fields to use certain keyboards and display certain styles (e.g., email keyboard and password protection)

I then added a push segue to get to the next screen where I uploaded a photo of myself and added it to an image view. 

For the final screen i uploaded another image, wrote some text in the text view and made sure everything was centered and aligned.
